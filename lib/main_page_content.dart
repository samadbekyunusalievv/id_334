const String whatIsAuctionText = '''
An auction is nothing but a sales event where buying and selling of products and services happen through bidding. People compete with each other to get hold of the item of their choice.\nTo secure the item one has to bid higher than the previous bidder, the price increases with each bid until no one else is willing to bid more than the current price. For example, if the last bid is \$50,000 and no one is willing to bid for \$50,500, the item will go to the buyer with the highest bid. \nIn an auction, one can find various objects like antique pieces, rare objects, properties, company or some artworks that include painting and others. In every auction house, there is a team of specialists who sets the prices for the items that are going to be used for auctions.
